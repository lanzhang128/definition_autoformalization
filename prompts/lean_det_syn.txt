General Instruction:
You are an expert in \emph{machine learning} and \emph{formal language Lean4}. Given the following definition in LaTeX: {{latex}}, your task is to provide the formal code of this definition in Lean4. The following text might contain some preliminaries to explain the given definition: {{preliminary}}. In case that you need to import any necessary dependent theory files, you should not import any fake theory files.{no_proof}

Additional Instructions:
1. For your reference, there are some previous formal codes generated by you: {{previous}}. The provided code might have some errors according to the Lean4 prover. The error details and where the error code is located in the code are: {{error_details}}. You should refine this piece of code for your task.
2. You should make sure that every symbol you use is a valid Lean4 symbol. Lean4 reserves some words as keywords. You should be careful with this and avoid to use them to define new names. You should make sure that the usage of symbols and operators is correct in your final output as the incorrect usage will lead to syntax errors.

Output Instruction:
