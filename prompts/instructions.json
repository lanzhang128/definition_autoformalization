    "General Instruction": "You are an expert in \\emph{machine learning} and \\emph{formal language Isabelle/HOL}. Given the following definition in LaTeX: {{latex}}, your task is to provide the formal code of this definition in Isabelle/HOL. The following text might contain some preliminaries to explain the given definition: {{preliminary}}. In case that you need to import any necessary dependent theory files, you should not import any fake theory files.",
    "Stylistic Instruction": "To represent the math symbols, you must use the textual full name of symbols in Isabelle instead of direct symbols. For example you should use \\<Rightarrow> instead of ⇒, \\<lambda> instead of λ.",
    "Output Instruction": "Give the results directly without any additional explanations.",
    "Additional Instructions": {
        "Binary Refinement": "For your reference, there are some previous formal codes generated by you: {{previous}}. The syntactic correctness for this piece of code is: {{correctness}}. You can choose to refine this piece of code for your task.",
        "Detailed Refinement": "For your reference, there are some previous formal codes generated by you: {{previous}}. The provided code might have some errors according to the Isabelle prover. The error details and where the error code is located in the code are: {{error_details}}. You should refine this piece of code for your task.",
        "Formal Definition Grounding": "You can use the following Isabelle/HOL codes to support your task: {{formal_defs}} but you should not restate these codes in your final output. You need to formalize everything that is not provided in the given code. In this case, you should assume that you can only use things from HOL.Main. You only need to provide the main body of formal codes for the given definition. You may not import any theory files."
