    "General Instruction": "You are an expert in \\emph{machine learning} and \\emph{formal language Isabelle/HOL}. Given the following definition in LaTeX: {{latex}}, your task is to provide the formal code of this definition in Isabelle/HOL. The following text might contain some preliminaries to explain the given definition: {{preliminary}}. In case that you need to import any necessary dependent theory files, you should not import any fake theory files.",
    "Stylistic Instruction": "To represent the math symbols, you must use the textual full name of symbols in Isabelle instead of direct symbols. For example you should use \\<Rightarrow> instead of ⇒, \\<lambda> instead of λ.",
    "Output Instruction": "Give the results directly without any additional explanations.",
    "Additional Instructions": {
        "Binary Correctness": "For your reference, there are some previous formal codes generated by you: {{previous}}. The syntactic correctness for this piece of code is: {{correctness}}. You can choose to refine this piece of code for your task.",
        "Detailed Correctness": "For your reference, there are some previous formal codes generated by you: {{previous}}. The provided code might have some errors according to the Isabelle prover. The error details and where the error code is located in the code are: {{error_details}}. You should refine this piece of code for your task.",
        "Soft-IFDC": "You can use the following Isabelle/HOL codes to support your task: {{formal_defs}} but you should not restate these codes in your final output. You need to formalize everything that is not provided in the given code. In this case, you should assume that you can only use things from HOL.Main. You only need to provide the main body of formal codes for the given definition. You may not import any theory files.",
        "Hard-IFDC": "The following Isabelle/HOL codes define some mathematical concepts which might be related to your task: {{formal_defs}}. If a mathematical concept in your task has been defined in the above codes, you are required to use this version of formal codes but you should not restate these codes in your final output. You need to formalize everything that is not provided in the given code. In this case, you should assume that you can only use things from HOL.Main. You only need to provide the main body of formal codes for the given definition. You may not import any theory files.",
        "SYN": "You should make sure that every symbol you use is a valid Isabelle symbol. If an Isabelle symbol starts with \\<, then it must end with >. Isabelle reserves some words as keywords. You should be careful with this and avoid to use them to define new names. You should make sure that the usage of symbols and operators is correct in your final output as the incorrect usage will lead to syntax errors.",
        "UDF": "You should make sure that every item you mentioned in your code has a clear reference either in the local context or the theory files that you decide to import.",
        "TUF": "You should make sure that in your code, the types of operands of operators or the types of parameters of functions match the types in their definitions exactly. Failure to maintain such compatibility will lead to type mismatch errors."
